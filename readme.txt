The game takes a satirical approach at Wikipedia[1]. Your character is
a "rouge" admin, and you must commit as many outrageous actions as
possible before you'll get forced out of Wikipedia. For each such
action you'll get Rouge points. You also have Karma points, which are
given for good actions and subtracted for bad actions. When you have
low karma, people would hate you a lot.

==Monsters==

noob - very weak and very stupid. If welcomed, becomes user.

user - standard guy without any special powers. If user is especially
good, he gets promoted to admin.

admin - can delete stuff and ban users (with banhammer). 

bureaucrat - can promote users to admins.

==Controls==

The controls are similar to other roguelike games:

move around (numpad/arrows)

wait ('5')

delete article or userbox ('d')

revert vandalism ('r')

switch weapon between banhammer and bare hands (you wield no weapon by
default). Banhammer doubles changes that you get to your stats during
combat. ('w')

look around ('l')

see next message (SPACE)

recap previous messages (BACKSPACE)

welcome n00b ('W')

quit ('Q')
