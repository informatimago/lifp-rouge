The Rougelike! is subject to GNU General Public License. You may
distribute and modify its source code and binaries as long as they
stay under the same license. rogue.exe was compiled with CLISP 2.38
for Windows, and includes all of it's source code. The exact source
code with which it was compiled may be provided by me if you REALLY
want it, because that's what CLISP licensing terms require to do. But
you probably don't want it because CLISP source code is freely
available from http://clisp.sourceforge.net.
