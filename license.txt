The Rougelike! (c) 2006 Timofei Shatrov

The Rougelike! (i.e. "rouge.lisp" and "rouge.exe") is subject to GNU
General Public License. You may distribute and modify its source code
and binaries as long as they stay under the same license. rogue.exe
was compiled with CLISP 2.40 for Windows, and includes all of it's
functionality. The exact source code with which it was compiled may be
provided by me if you REALLY want it, because that's what CLISP
licensing terms require to do. But you probably don't want it because
CLISP source code is freely available from http://clisp.sourceforge.net.

The PDCurses interface, consisting of "curses.lisp" is NOT provided
under GPL terms, and you can use it for any purpose.
